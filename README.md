# ChitChat
This is a web chat application. You can create room as well as private chat window on the go.

By default, one-to-one chat window is activated. With some change in index.js file in can be converted into room for more people to join in.
In one-to-one chat if third person joins it will show access denied because of condition present in index.js--io.on function.

I will also try to enhace it coming days.

Thank You.
